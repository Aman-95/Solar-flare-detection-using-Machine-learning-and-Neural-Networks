# Solar-flare-detection-using-Machine-learning-and-Neural-Networks
Various Machine learning models and neural networks trained to predict solar flares with reasonable accuracy 

We have collected data of past 23 years (from 1997 to 2020) from the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which were initially in pdf form. We then extracted the useful data from these pdf files and store them in .xlsx file. We did some preprocessing on the data to convert in the final form.We have trained various machine learning models on this dataset to classify and predict solar flares.

For more information we have also attached our project report.
